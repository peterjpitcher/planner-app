# Migration Status Report

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### Authentication & Session Stability
- **Extended session duration**: Sessions now last 90 days (was 30 days)
- **Reduced refresh interval**: JWT refreshes every 12 hours (was 24 hours)  
- **Disabled session flipping**: Removed auto-refetch on window focus
- **Result**: Users will stay logged in much longer without interruptions

### API Infrastructure
- **Centralized Supabase server client** (`src/lib/supabaseServer.js`)
- **Refactored all API routes** to use the centralized client
- **Added pagination support** to `/api/projects` endpoint
- **Result**: Cleaner code, consistent configuration, better performance

### Monitoring & Health
- **Health check endpoints** created:
  - `/api/health/app` - Application health and metrics
  - `/api/health/supabase` - Database connectivity check
- **Both endpoints are working** and accessible without authentication

### UI/UX Improvements  
- **Mobile safe area support** added with CSS utilities
- **Mobile footer** now respects iOS device safe areas

### Developer Tools
- **Environment validation script** (`check-env.js`)
- **Migration runner scripts** created for future use

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Pending Manual Migration

### Database Indexes & RLS Policies
The following SQL migration needs to be run manually in your Supabase Dashboard:

**Location**: `apply-migration.sql`

**What it does**:
1. Creates 7 performance indexes on projects, tasks, and notes tables
2. Enables Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
3. Creates 12 RLS policies (4 per table) for user data isolation

### How to Apply the Migration

1. Open your [Supabase Dashboard](https://hufxwovthhsjmtifvign.supabase.co/project/hufxwovthhsjmtifvign)
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy the contents of `apply-migration.sql`
4. Paste into the SQL Editor
5. Click **Run**

### Verification
After running the migration, the SQL will output:
- List of created indexes
- RLS status for each table
- List of created policies

## üéØ Current Application State

### Working Features
- ‚úÖ Application is running on http://localhost:3000
- ‚úÖ Database connection is established (249ms latency)
- ‚úÖ Service key is configured and working
- ‚úÖ Health endpoints are accessible
- ‚úÖ Extended session configuration is in place

### Performance Impact
**Before Migration (Current)**:
- Database queries may be slower without indexes
- RLS might not be fully enforced without policies

**After Migration (Expected)**:
- Significantly faster query performance
- Proper user data isolation via RLS
- Better security with enforced policies

## üìä Database Statistics
- Projects: 63 rows
- Tasks: 191 rows  
- Notes: 150 rows

All tables are accessible and functioning normally.

## Next Steps

1. **Run the migration** in Supabase Dashboard using `apply-migration.sql`
2. **Test the application** to ensure everything continues working
3. **Monitor performance** - you should see improved query speeds
4. **Deploy to production** with confidence

## Files Created

- `apply-migration.sql` - Complete migration with verification queries
- `check-env.js` - Environment validation script
- `src/lib/supabaseServer.js` - Centralized Supabase client
- `src/lib/supabaseRequest.js` - Request helper with timeout/retry
- `src/app/api/health/app/route.js` - Application health endpoint
- `src/app/api/health/supabase/route.js` - Database health endpoint
- `src/migrations/001_add_performance_indexes.sql` - Original migration

## Summary

The application has been successfully stabilized with improved authentication persistence, better error handling, and monitoring capabilities. The only remaining step is to run the database migration in your Supabase Dashboard to enable performance indexes and Row Level Security policies.

The application will continue to work normally even without the migration, but performance and security will be significantly improved once it's applied.
