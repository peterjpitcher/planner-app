Fundamentals Hey Prompt Entrepreneur ve ever looked prompt engineering guide ll quickly find yourself world strange terminology zero shot few shot chain thought retrieval augmented generation can get complicated fast maybe even little intimidating last Part talked about how prompt engineering its core about communicating All layers technical terminology get way fact re probably already using many techniques intuitively just don t know formal names them I ll describe ways prompting ll probably have few well duh I m already doing moments s great re going explore terminology two important reasons first expand toolkit options second so know what someone talking about when use terms articles discussions always remember beneath all technical jargon s still fundamentally about clear communication AI systems Let s get started Summary Prompting Terminology Widening prompting toolkit established techniques Zero shot one shot few shot prompting explained power examples both positive negative Alternative ways provide context beyond prompt itself might already using some approaches intuitively understanding formal patterns when apply them gives greater control over AI interactions s sort like learning foreign language necessarily knowing finer points grammar s fine can talk people problem layering grammar helps understand why things work certain way Most importantly single technique universally better than others each has specific strengths ideal use cases recurring theme Playbook Think techniques different tools toolkit each designed particular situations Need quick results straightforward task Zero shot prompting might perfect Working highly structured output specific formatting Few shot prompting examples likely best bet Need expand full knowledge base File uploads Projects RAG friends key matching technique objective often combining multiple approaches optimal results Let s review what re working Shot Spectrum From Zero Few One most fundamental distinctions prompting how many examples provide before asking specific output commonly referred shot prompting ranging from zero shot examples few shot multiple examples Zero Shot Prompting Examples Needed Zero shot prompting simplest approach provide instructions without any examples asking AI perform task hasn t explicitly been shown how do prompt example Write short poem about artificial intelligence Zero shot works remarkably well straightforward tasks especially more powerful models s quick requires minimal setup Most ad hoc quick queries AI zero shot When use zero shot simple common tasks When re concerned about specific formatting creative open ended requests When want test AI s default approach When re hurry need quick response One Shot Prompting Learning from Single Example One shot prompting involves giving AI single example before asking perform similar task Here s example product description Echo Dot voice controlled smart speaker Alexa has sleek compact design fits anywhere home Ask Alexa play music answer questions read news check weather set alarms control compatible smart home devices more Now write similar product description Philips Hue Smart Bulb approach significantly improves consistency helps AI understand exactly what re looking terms style tone format When use one shot When have specific format style mind tasks where consistency previous work matters When zero shot responses aren t quite hitting mark When want guide AI without extensive examples One shot still pretty fast especially just copy pasting example aside used recommended place examples first ChatGPT last Claude I m certain all different models have different recommendations Increasingly though matters less less models can work out what aiming said try both before after new chats see what works better use moving forward Always test Few Shot Prompting Patterns from Multiple Examples Few shot prompting takes concept further providing multiple examples Here three examples professional email responses customer inquiries Customer When my order arrive Response Thank inquiry about order status Based records package scheduled arrive date can track shipment using tracking number provided confirmation email Please let know need any further assistance Customer I received wrong item my order Response I m sorry hear received incorrect item sincerely apologise inconvenience Please provide order number so can resolve issue promptly can arrange return incorrect item ensure correct item sent soon possible Customer Do offer refunds Response Yes do offer refunds items returned within 30 days purchase original condition full refund policy can found website under Customer Service d like initiate return please provide order number ll guide through process Customer Can I change my shipping address after placing my order Response so so technique powerful establishing complex patterns multiple examples AI can identify consistent elements across variations leading more nuanced understanding expectations When use few shot complex tasks subtle patterns When consistency critical When working formats have specific structural requirements When task involves multiple dimensions tone format reasoning approach specialised knowledge domains Few shot more advanced requires more work set up Also increasingly don t put all examples prompt itself instead supply them externally I ll talk more about how later Examples Quality Variety Counterexamples While number examples matters quality what type even more important couple pointers Quality Over Quantity Boring important single well chosen example often outperforms multiple mediocre ones examples should clearly demonstrate exact pattern want followed all elements consider important Hint can use AI help brainstorm good examples Include Variety provide multiple examples too similar AI might fixate irrelevant patterns Include variety help model understand which aspects should remain consistent which can vary instance creating customer service responses vary scenarios customer tones specific solutions while maintaining consistent professional tone structure Use Negative Examples One most powerful still underused strats providing negative examples Specifically showing what DON T want alongside what do want GOOD EXAMPLE quarterly report shows 15 increase revenue primarily driven new product line which captured significant market share enterprise segment BAD EXAMPLE Revenue went up 15 quarter because new products sold really well big companies Please write professional summary customer satisfaction survey results style GOOD example BAD example Negative examples help define boundaries clarify expectations often resolving ambiguities positive examples alone might miss re particularly valuable when ve received outputs have specific flaws want avoid get some bad results back from AI can feed them back bad examples Even better explain why bad System Contextual Role Prompting shot techniques ve discussed fundamentally about providing examples context sometimes including all necessary context directly prompt becomes impractical due length limitations complexity Beyond shot techniques several complementary approaches help establish foundation AI interactions Increasingly ll use tools rather than trying put ALL context prompt itself Think techniques external prompt can have external repository examples context works alongside prompts most part replace few shot prompting System Prompting Many AI interfaces distinguish between system prompts user prompts System prompts define how AI should operate throughout entire conversation even across conversations while user prompts contain specific requests System prompting involves establishing parameters persist across entire conversation example AI assistant helping product design Always approach questions from first principles focus user needs suggest specific actionable next steps Challenge assumptions when seem ungrounded Use simple language without jargon main value here allowing build context all interactions without having repeat yourself External Reference Methods All approaches serve similar purpose giving AI more information work beyond what fits standard prompt can thus give many more examples than added them prompt itself File Upload lets reference specific documents without copying content prompt When upload file AI can analyse respond questions about making ideal working specific documents data sets images Certain models have much higher context windows think memory allowing upload many more larger files Google s Gemini models particular excel here Projects Knowledge Bases create persistent collections information AI can access across multiple conversations might include company documentation previous conversations specialised resources inform AI s responses without needing included each prompt Both ChatGPT Claude have Projects directly webapps phone app interfaces Retrieval Augmented Generation RAG takes step further dynamically fetching relevant information from knowledge base when needed content stored vector database system pulls only most relevant information each query effectively extending AI s knowledge specific information more when working API rather than via webapp s more advanced technique sure approaches all address similar needs Working information too extensive fit prompt Maintaining consistent access proprietary information Keeping references up date without rewriting prompts simply add change uploaded information goal remains same shot techniques provide AI context needs generate accurate relevant helpful responses difference merely how where context stored accessed which use depends entirely how many examples how much context needed do task hand well What s Next ve expanded prompting vocabulary include range established techniques from zero shot few shot how can manage larger bodies examples Next ll explore

AI first time clicked immediately got solid results continued using skilled up kept up date have become power users can t imagine life without AI others maybe gave AI shot didn t get results expected gave up ones who likely say eh AI overhyped s bubble like ones who fall behind When working two groups I ll have them run basic prompting exercise So I get see sort prompts using AI Without fail those who don t think much AI using crappy prompts Think write me some good marketing copy level crappy prompts difference between two groups technical knowledge difference between two groups those who get good results those who get bad results from AI how prompt Prompting its base communication skill skill s something can refine practice Some people naturally speak AI s language others need learn all without exception can get better s exactly what re focusing Playbook Let s get started Summary Prompting Foundations Why prompting fundamentally communication skill difference between effective ineffective AI communicators RISEN framework one approach clear communication Common communication barriers undermine AI results How adapt communication style better AI interactions Communication Divide early days personal computing people spoke about being computer literate having basic skills operate new machines Today re facing similar divide AI s about technical skills s about communication Some people naturally click AI tools instinctively understand how communicate intentions clearly frame requests effectively iterate when necessary Others struggle finding themselves frustrated inconsistent off target results first group might sometimes find yourself wondering why other people find so difficult just stupid divide about intelligence technical knowledge I ve seen brilliant developers struggle prompting while non technical folks get magnificent results s specifically about communication style clarity Great news those who less technical new paradigm working computers opens up opportunities communicators good news everyone unlike coding advanced technical skills effective AI communication can learned quickly s skill builds capabilities many already have just need adapt them new context RISEN Framework Starting Point help bridge communication gap I ve developed RISEN framework straightforward approach structuring prompts R Role Establish who what AI should I Instructions Provide clear specific directions S Steps Break complex tasks manageable pieces E End Goal Clarify what success looks like N Narrowing Add constraints refine output Here s video detailing framework Watch now TikTok iamkylebalmer re using chatgpt wrong Learn basic framework instantly upgrade prompt engineering productivity ai artificialintell See more Let s briefly explore each element ROLE Setting Context Starting prompt assigning specific role AI immediately establishes context perspective s like telling colleague Put marketing hat moment Think about from engineer s perspective example rather than asking How do I improve my sales pitch Try experienced sales director who has closed deals Fortune 500 companies help me improve my sales pitch role assign shapes how AI approaches request often leading more tailored relevant responses s useful because AI can wear any hat which means tends toward generic responses specifying what role want take right now can refine answers INSTRUCTIONS Crystal Clear Directions After establishing role provide explicit instructions about what want more specific better Poor instructions vague Give me content ideas Better instructions specific Generate 5 LinkedIn post ideas about artificial intelligence small business owners each surprising statistic insight highlights practical benefits rather than technical details second example gives AI clear guidelines about quantity topic audience content type emphasis all crucial elements generating useful output STEPS Breaking Down Complexity complex requests breaking task sequential steps dramatically improves results particularly effective analytical tasks writing assignments any request requires structured thinking Instead Analyze marketing data give me recommendations Try Analyze marketing data 1 Identifying top 3 performing channels ROI 2 Highlighting unexpected trends anomalies 3 Comparing quarter s performance previous quarter 4 Recommending 3 specific actions based insights best way think about were providing complex task human assistant Sure know how complete particular task maybe assistant doesn t least first time Because break down task them ll do same AI END GOAL Defining Success Always clearly state what re trying accomplish What s ultimate purpose prompt What problem solving What does success look like So many people get annoyed poor results from AI point did actually specify what success looks like so how know good prompt example might look like goal create email template increases webinar registration rate addressing audience s pain points creating urgency without sounding pushy Specifying end goal helps AI prioritise most relevant information approach task desired outcome mind NARROWING Refining Through Constraints After get initial response magic happens narrowing phase where add constraints preferences additional context refine output instance receive sales email s too formal good please make more conversational friendly Use shorter sentences avoid jargon add touch humour would appeal creative professionals Narrowing iterative process helps AI better understand expectations preferences can also keep record narrowing constraints ll use similar prompts indeed build them reusable prompts Beyond Frameworks While RISEN framework provides helpful structure fundamental principle clear communication s all s only best framework become more experienced may develop own approaches simplify prompts while maintaining clarity ultimate goal isn t rigidly follow framework communicate effectively AI systems s just scaffolding get used thinking about prompting read communication more systematically Some situations might call elaborate prompts others might need just few well chosen words ability judge what s needed each context improve practice Remember even most advanced AI systems can t read mind can only work information provide clearer more complete communication better results Common Communication Barriers Several patterns consistently undermine effective AI communication Assuming Mind Reading Abilities Many users unconsciously expect AI fill contextual gaps seem obvious humans Remember AI has access prior knowledge intentions unless explicitly state them fix think about what information would provide human assistant provide same level context AI Overcorrecting Extreme Detail Some users swing opposite extreme creating prompts so long convoluted key instructions get buried Clarity doesn t always mean verbosity likely happen when start uploading loads documents supplemental material all hides actual core instructions Using Ambiguous Language Phrases like make good improve too subjective actionable specific about what good improved means context straight up communication failure precise Neglecting Iterate Effective AI communication often dialogue one shot interaction prepared refine request based initial responses ll talk more about different styles prompts how cement them workflows over Playbook Recognising patterns own interactions first step toward more effective AI communication Hopefully least one pops out something do so stop What s Next

earth meant make any lasting AI business decisions when all shifting so quickly Over past four days ve built solid foundation knowledge about how AI works now understand evolution systems how function prediction engines distinction between training inference critical importance data question still OK what do I actually DO all I m going answer question giving practical implementation framework step step roadmap can use deploy AI own business help clients consultant more paralysis analysis more overwhelm Just clear actionable steps move forward Let s get started Summary Practical AI deployment three levels AI implementation maturity practical roadmap from simple sophisticated Specific tools technologies use each level Clear indicators when level up Common pitfalls avoid along journey AI Implementation Maturity Model Before dive details let s look big picture Here s outline maturity model providing lear progression from simple beginnings more advanced implementations Level Description Key Technologies When Use Examples Level 1 Getting Started Simple AI integrations existing tools workflows ChatGPT Claude Midjourney Public APIs Starting point all businesses Content generation research assistance basic automation Level 2 Building Custom Solutions Implementing RAG systems proprietary data Vector databases embedding APIs LangChain LlamaIndex When have valuable proprietary data specific use cases Customer support bots internal knowledge bases Level 3 Advanced Implementation Fine tuning models sophisticated applications Fine tuning APIs OpenAI Hugging Face model deployment platforms Replicate When need deeper customisation have domain specific requirements Industry specific tools complex workflows personalised experiences covered RAG fine tuning last Part now re talking about how actually step up deploy I know ll want jump cool stuff Level 3 company needs grow same time implementing new tools Step step best Level 1 Getting Started Level 1 all about quick wins low hanging fruit re using existing AI tools services without any custom development complex integration Think off shelf AI level involves Using public AI models through interfaces ChatGPT Claude Midjourney Simple API integrations existing tools Learning effective prompting techniques Establishing basic AI workflows Tools Technologies level re primarily using tools like General AI assistants ChatGPT Plus Claude Bard Image generation Midjourney DALL E Stable Diffusion Basic code tools Bubble AI plugins Webflow AI features AI enhanced office tools Microsoft Copilot Google Workspace AI features non exhaustive obviously MANY too many tools level Real World Examples marketing agency might use ChatGPT draft initial content outlines Midjourney generate concept images Zapier automate posting social media platforms law firm might use Claude summarise legal documents extract key clauses generate first drafts standard correspondence solo entrepreneur might use AI assistants research content creation email management without any custom development bread butter stuff cover extensively Prompt Entrepreneur Playbooks where all businesses entrepreneurs need start find footing When Level Up should consider moving Level 2 when find yourself constantly feeding same context AI tools prompts have become complex multi page documents have valuable proprietary data could enhance AI outputs re spending significant time repetitive AI interactions have team people who don t necessarily have level AI sophistication Common Pitfalls Level 1 Watch out shiny object syndrome trying every new AI tool rather than mastering few unrealistic expectations expecting perfect outputs without proper prompting security blindspots feeding sensitive information public AI systems forgetting human oversight deploying AI generated content without proper review Level 2 Building Custom Solutions Once above seems old hat s time move up level Specifically re going put together RAG system using company s knowledge What Looks Like Level 2 where start creating more customised AI solutions leverage data re longer just using public tools re building simple tailored applications off back internal knowledge level involves Implementing Retrieval Augmented Generation RAG systems Creating specialised AI workflows specific use cases Integrating AI capabilities existing products services Some custom development often using frameworks libraries Tools Technologies level re primarily using Vector databases Pinecone MongoDB Weaviate Chroma RAG frameworks LangChain LlamaIndex Embedding APIs OpenAI embeddings Cohere embeddings low code AI platforms Retool Bubble FlutterFlow AI components Document processing PyPDF LangChain document loaders Real World Examples real estate company might build RAG system property listings market analyses historical transaction data allowing agents query knowledge base specific client needs software company might create internal AI assistant has access codebase documentation support tickets help developers solve problems faster e commerce business might implement product recommendation system combines general AI capabilities specific product catalog customer purchase history When Level Up should consider moving Level 3 when RAG system struggles complex reasoning about domain need more consistent adherence specific formats terminology have enough high quality training data support fine tuning business value justifies deeper investment customisation Common Pitfalls Level 2 careful poor data quality GIGO Garbage Garbage Out chunking issues improper document chunking leading lost context over reliance RAG sometimes fine tuning necessary see next step neglecting user experience building technically sound systems difficult end users Level 3 Advanced Implementation Let s now layer fine tuning top previous work really refine systems What Looks Like Level 3 represents significant step up sophistication re now building deeply customised AI capabilities specifically tailored domain use case level involves Fine tuning models specific use cases Building sophisticated applications multiple AI components More extensive custom development Tools Technologies level re primarily using Fine tuning services OpenAI fine tuning API Anthropic fine tuning Hugging Face Model deployment platforms Replicate Modal Specialised AI services OpenAI Assistants API Azure AI services Advanced orchestration Langfuse LiteLLM Monitoring tools Weights Biases Helicone Development frameworks LangChain advanced features DSPy Real World Examples healthcare company might fine tune models medical documentation create AI system can extract patient information suggest diagnosis codes draft preliminary reports physician review financial services firm might build comprehensive system combines market data analysis regulatory compliance checking personalised client recommendations manufacturing company might implement AI quality control system analyses images sensor data detect defects predict maintenance needs optimise production processes When Level Up Further AI journey progresses beyond Level 3 might eventually consider more advanced implementations when AI has proven so valuable needs embedded throughout organisation business strategy relies AI core competitive advantage most businesses focusing mastering Levels 1 3 get them long way ahead competitors Common Pitfalls Level 3 Watch over investing fine tuning when RAG might work just well data leakage properly separating training test data fragmented implementation building isolated systems scaling too fast implementing across too many areas simultaneously neglecting governance ie ignoring privacy ethical considerations Wrapping Up Week ve covered lot ground week Part 1 traced AI s evolution from rule based systems neural networks power today s generative AI understanding how shift fundamentally changes how interact computers Part 2 explored how large language models work sophisticated prediction engines using patterns text generate human like responses without true understanding Part 3 distinguished between training inference understanding why creating models expensive using them relatively affordable why should focus leveraging existing models rather than building own Part 4 examined how data fuels AI systems why quality trumps quantity especially entrepreneurs using fine tuning RAG leverage proprietary data Part 5 ve provided practical roadmap AI implementation from simple beginnings sophisticated systems giving framework can use own business consultant knowledge gives solid foundation making informed decisions about AI business understand how systems work what re good what struggle thus how implement them effectively various levels
