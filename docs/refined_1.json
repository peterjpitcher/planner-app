Automation Accelerator starts next week Build package up AI Automations ready sell businesses First accelerator great success so re running another one Ok so re going approach leadership company maybe ve managed talk way call company don t work Good job Now what first instinct might prepare comprehensive workshop demonstrating all amazing things AI can do Text generation Image creation Video synthesis Audio production AI avatars smorgasbord approach Don t do I ve seen mistake countless times Someone finally gets shot executives proceeds overwhelm them buffet AI capabilities hoping something anything stick s equivalent throwing spaghetti wall all those Just Stop Oil protests have shown executives hate having spaghetti thrown them especially re wearing nice suits Executives have extremely limited time primary job make decisions only job during executive briefing help them make decision short amount time s what decision aiming s commitment six figure pilot program s automating entire HR department s simply Ok want do something AI seem know what re doing lead s all need from first meeting Just enough commitment move next step whether s staff workshop small pilot project deeper dive session Get first yes re way AI working Here s how can future proof yourself 2 Master AI tools tutorials news just 3 minutes day 3 Become 10X more productive using AI Join 1 000 000 pros companies like Google Meta Amazon using AI get ahead Let s get started Summary Building briefing Why executives need different briefing formats 5 15 30 minutes Universal three act structure Tailoring approach elevator pitches initial meetings formal presentations How maintain pace ensure get decision Common pitfalls derail executive briefings Truth About Executive Time Attention Executives operate different reality than rest calendars booked weeks advance I just booked call high flyer s 2 months from now He s just booked up until s attention pulled dozen directions simultaneously ultimate currency isn t money s time Which incidentally why people start get longevity bio hacking once ve made enough money need more time reality shapes how need approach them about AI must prepared deliver value whatever time window re given whether s 5 minute elevator conversation 15 minute introductory meeting full 30 minute presentation slot Here s golden rule executive briefings one ever complains about something being too short Get mind out gutter giggled hate when movie goes too long when s too short just means loved want more Ditto presentations re scheduled 15 minutes prepare deliver core message 10 ve got 30 minutes aim cover essential points 20 leaves room questions which where real engagement happens shorter briefing better meeting runs longer than scheduled s because re interested s win try cram 30 minutes content 15 minute slot ll lose them before ever get point Universal Three Act Structure Regardless whether have 5 15 30 minutes all effective executive briefings follow same three act structure Act 1 Why AI Matters Specific Business Make case why AI should priority list specific relevance industry company size competitive landscape Act 2 One Concrete Example Real World Impact Show don t tell Demonstrate one clear specific use case tangible results can relate business Act 3 Clear Actionable Next Steps Tell them exactly what decision need them make today what immediate next action looks like structure works because aligns how executives make decisions 1 relevant me Act 1 2 Can I see evidence works Act 2 3 What s immediate action Act 3 alternatively why should I care about Prove OK fine what s action difference between time formats isn t structure s depth breadth what cover each act Over next few Parts Playbook ll cover each Acts one per Part now need know outline so know where going 5 Minute Elevator Pitch 5 minute briefing isn t actually formal briefing s elevator pitch happens hallways before meetings when unexpectedly find yourself executive access What Include single industry specific pain point AI can solve One example clear quantifiable results Company X did saved Y Request specific follow up usually proper meeting What Cut Technical details any kind very likely won t have screen any visual aids so s got verbally understandable Multiple use cases examples One example only make work Lengthy explanations how AI works isn t lecture Goal Secure longer meeting where can present more formally Example Opening Companies industry seeing 35 productivity gains specific department implementing targeted AI solutions Here s paper from Harvard Business Review about I ve identified three areas where could see similar results Could I get 15 minutes calendar walk through specifics When have just 5 minutes re trying get full commitment AI implementation re simply trying get enough interest proper conversation ready also deliver ever shorter time can get 30 seconds Good 15 Minute Meeting Format 15 minute briefing most common scenario initial meeting where have just enough time make case secure commitment next step I would personally do without slides so can focus engagement Slides also mean technical setup dependencies spend first 3 minutes faffing getting slide deck screen making sure everyone can see ve lost 20 time Too risky Structure Breakdown Act 1 Why AI Matters 3 minutes Act 2 One Detailed Example 8 minutes Act 3 Next Steps Decision Request 4 minutes What Include Industry specific AI trends competitive pressures One fully developed example before after comparison Clear ROI metrics from example Specific proposal next steps workshop pilot etc What Cut Slides Personally I d run without slides one use what works Multiple examples stick strongest one still don t have anywhere near enough time multiple examples choose one nail Long term visions stay focused immediate value immediate wins Goal Secure commitment concrete next step typically workshop broader staff small proof concept project timeframe ideal s long enough make compelling case short enough maintain focus urgency meeting goes longer great Deliver material efficiently shift Q re asking questions re interested I ve written multiple Playbooks how up AI knowledge able answer more depth questions Refer back those need refresher 30 Minute Presentation 30 minute briefing typically formal presentation where have opportunity build comprehensive case AI adoption point may bring slides have enough space breathe having some visual examples screen compelling Keep super light though goodness me don t just read from slides presenting room stay out from behind laptop too s charisma dead zone Structure Breakdown Act 1 Why AI Matters 7 minutes Act 2 Primary Example Supporting Cases 15 minutes Act 3 Implementation Roadmap Decision Request 8 minutes What Include Comprehensive business case industry data One primary example explored depth can really stretch wings here give full details Importantly can better prove business case 1 2 supporting examples showing breadth application Think objections use supplementary short examples knock them down example might have one about cost pilot programmes can low cost one data protection ll do internally secure data Specific decision request clear next actions What Cut Technical deep dives Still need technicals talking executives don t need technical breakdowns Overly ambitious proposals want little sizzle sure go too hard ll lose trust Goal Secure formal approval defined initiative whether s department wide workshop funded pilot project engagement advisor failing secure request proposal from Even 30 minutes remember less more Better thoroughly cover fewer points than race through comprehensive overview leaves executives confused about what re actually proposing Common Pitfalls Avoid Here most common mistakes I see executive AI briefings Overly technical Focusing AI capabilities instead business outcomes Executives don t care about how technology works care about what does business Leave acronyms home I hear say gradient descent back propagation I m going bust through window board room myself shut down Overly stuffed Trying cover every possible AI application instead focusing highest value opportunities Yes AI can do awful lot trying cover all potential uses dilutes any single one Hone one immediately valuable use case business focus here Ambiguous Ask Ending without clear decision request Always explicit about what decision need today Give them next steps ask interested stop talking Works wonders Fantasy Land Painting picture AI transformation s so ambitious seems unrealistic Start concrete achievable wins Execs bombarded AI hype already acknowledge say re going instead focus stuff can do right now Generate Briefing Outline OK ve covered lot Let s condense prompt Here s prompt help create customised briefing outline specific industry timeframe expert executive communications about AI adoption
