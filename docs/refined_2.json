had better get serious about living demons within Let s get started Summary Should slow down AI Why slowing down AI like trying slow down internet geopolitical reality vs China AI race How competitive pressures cascade from nations companies individuals real risks economic disruption social deterioration wealth concentration Why education democratisation matter more than deceleration Three Perspectives AI Speed AI moving fast REAL fast I cover pretty much full time I can t keep up People rightfully ask me about whether problem speed change risk I typically encounter three distinct viewpoints Position 1 Need Pump Brakes Now safety first view argues re racing toward potential catastrophe re building increasingly powerful systems don t fully understand Without proper safety measures alignment research risk creating AI could harm humanity whether through accidents misuse eventually systems pursue goals misaligned human values need international treaties research moratoriums strict regulations before s too late Sometimes slips Terminator narrative Which all new robots being developed isn t terribly surprising Proponents point nuclear weapons precedent developed international frameworks prevent spread More less Why do same potentially transformative AI Position 2 Full Speed Ahead Western acceleration camp dismisses calls caution Slowing down both impossible counterproductive China won t pause AI development just because re nervous benefits AI medicine science education too important delay Plus competition drives innovation Artificial slowdowns would only ensure authoritarian regimes get AGI first Basically full steam ahead ll work out go along view often emphasises can t predict risks accurately anyway so might well capture benefits while maintaining competitive edge don t someone else Position 3 Race Already my opinion question Should slow down AI development fundamentally misunderstands current situation technological cat already out bag knowledge exists papers published multiple nations racing ahead Debating slow down isn t practical anymore Cat Out Bag Let me blunt about something might unpopular debate about slowing down AI development largely academic Various global bodies may spend next few years discussing stuff put out some very serious sounding papers very serious conferences Probably Switzerland doesn t matter fundamental technologies already public research papers published Open source models freely available knowledge exists Godfather AI Geoffrey Hinton said open sourcing large models s too late now cat s out bag crazy move He also compared making nuclear material freely available one top AI researchers all time Basically s done Fait accompli Asking should slow down AI development like asking should slow down internet 1995 s question wrong s misunderstands nature general purpose technologies technologies don t have central off switch Once work out how electricity works tell other people s humanity has electricity sort technologies permeate everything transform everything ultimately become part everything can t unring bell Sorry Geopolitical Reality two players AI play board right now China Sorry Europe especially Mistral re outta here Despite all handwringing EU reality has become two player game national level context here I used live China speak passable Mandarin studied Chinese history Oxford I have also lived America 6 years including getting my MBA New York Oh I m British those who didn t know technically Bri ish because I m from South London I Beijing recently browsing local bookstore something struck me bestsellers weren t business books self help guides were books about DeepSeek one China s very good homegrown AI systems tucked away technology section prominently displayed essential reading everyone from students business leaders were first books saw when came books counters being pushed HARD China isn t debating whether slow down re accelerating AI adoption across education business daily life intensity national mission School kids getting mandatory lessons use AI creates prisoner s dilemma Even United States wanted slow down AI development safety reasons doing so would simply cede technological leadership China Any unilateral slowdown one nation becomes strategic advantage other means top level slowdown s out question Cascade Effect same dynamic repeats itself every level society Corporate Level Imagine bank decides slow down its AI adoption ethical reasons Noble intention I respect while re being cautious competitors using AI offer instant loan approvals personalised financial advice fraud detection actually works Guess which bank loses market share Companies hesitate don t just fall behind risk becoming irrelevant s even mentioning new AI first entrants who come eat incumbents lunch Individual Level same pressure exists professionals I have colleagues who boast about using AI tools preferring do things old fashioned way s sorta fine now when competitors producing higher quality work fraction time how long can position last Yeah my guess ll quietly just start using AI without same fanfare using isn t about replacing human creativity judgment s about augmenting human capabilities Those who refuse adapt risk becoming equivalent accountants who insisted using paper ledgers after spreadsheets were invented trying do checks notes anything without internet doable Yes absolutely s very hard stay competitive following artisanal route Real Dangers Face Now am I saying should proceed without caution Absolutely risks real substantial Economic Disruption discussed earlier series how AI won t just take jobs fundamentally restructure entire industries re looking economic transformation scale seen since Industrial Revolution Maybe more don t know new Wealth Concentration AI development currently controlled handful massive corporations government backing re watching greatest consolidation power wealth human history unfold real time whole concern about wealth gaps 1 over last decade may look quaint compared what re about see Imagine what happens first company who hits AGI what AI companies racing right now Because power control wealth generated from point unprecedented Social Deterioration I ve already seen concerning trends people preferring AI companions human relationships skills atrophying AI handles more cognitive tasks attention spans shrinking AI delivers instant answers every question I get several requests sponsored posts each week from AI girlfriend companies have good budgets because surprise people paying I politely decline Geopolitical Instability AI powered warfare could allow technologically advanced nations project force minimal human cost side asymmetry could de stabilize international relations unprecedented ways I can send drones robots rather than my citizens which gets me booted from office calculus warmongering changes dramatically barriers entry war decrease civilisation level challenges Quite few them All once should absolutely concerned Path Forward Democratisation Over Deceleration here s where my perspective might surprise answer isn t slow down s speed up different direction Right now AI development concentrated among few giant corporations nation states Every breakthrough increases power Every advancement widens gap between AI haves AI have nots antidote isn t deceleration s democratisation why I spend my time teaching entrepreneurs small business owners how leverage AI because I think everyone needs become machine learning engineer because distributed knowledge best defence against concentrated power When millions people understand AI can build AI can create value AI create counterbalance corporate state control possible I don t know s big ask need least try can t just cede total control technologies billionaires ultimately what I tell clients audience members who have concerns Basically s too late I m afraid So all can do carve out own space new world Wrapping Up OK covered some big topic Playbook Let s recap journey ve taken Part 1 AI Take Jobs explored how AI transform employment through gradual erosion rather than sudden replacement particularly affecting entry level positions Part 2 AI Really Intelligent Just Mimicry tackled philosophical debate about machine consciousness concluding practical capabilities matter more than abstract definitions intelligence Part 3 AI Overhyped Truly Transformative examined how AI can both overhyped specific applications genuinely transformative general purpose technology much like internet revolution Part 4 What About AI s Environmental Impact addressed environmental concerns finding while energy consumption real needs context alongside other digital activities ongoing efficiency improvements Part 5 Should Slow Down AI Development Today ve confronted governance challenge recognising path forward lies democratisation education rather than futile attempts deceleration AI experts consultants educators role isn t just understand issues help others navigate them thoughtfully I hope what I ve been able do Playbook course don t need agree me fact I d surprised did Instead purpose series give starting off points think about topics articulate own arguments completely counter mine all better Keep Prompting Kyle When ready AI Entrepreneurship

environmental impact question always comes up I mean always Whether s during keynote client meetings casual conversations about AI never fails Once I d barely finished my talk when hand shot up what about all water AI uses I read each ChatGPT query guzzles whole bottle water I had seen shaking head squinting me whole talk so knew something coming room nodded knowingly tidbit had clearly made rounds another AI horror story add collection I took deep breath knowing I about burst rather popular bubble Actually I said water story mostly red herring real environmental challenge AI electricity water even needs context puzzled looks told me going one those conversations Perfect exactly kind nuanced discussion need have about AI s environmental impact Let s get started Summary AI bad environment bottle water per query claim real issue electricity consumption How AI s energy use compares other industries everyday activities Industry responses including nuclear power efficiency improvements Practical steps businesses can take minimise AI environmental footprint Three Camps When comes AI s environmental impact I typically encounter three distinct perspectives Position 1 AI Environmental Catastrophe environmentally alarmed view sees AI ecological disaster making Every ChatGPT query consumes bottle water Data centres soon use much electricity entire countries re facing climate emergency can t afford frivolous technology burning through resources just so people can generate cat memes crappy poetry perspective often cites dramatic statistics about water usage exponential growth energy consumption painting AI unsustainable luxury can t afford warming world Position 2 Environmental Concerns Overblown opposite extreme techno optimist view dismisses environmental worries entirely AI efficiency improves faster than consumption grows Besides AI solve far more environmental problems than creates from optimising power grids accelerating renewable energy research Market forces ensure efficiency improvements happen automatically camp sees environmental concerns either exaggerated soon solved very technology being criticised Basically ll able outrun problems create using very same AI very common human point view ll fix later don t worry Position 3 Real Concerns Context Matters My position occupies more nuanced middle ground AI s environmental impact real growing needs understood accurately context have look actual facts figures gross rather than just opinions what want true Water Myth First let s tackle water bottle claim head gets way actually discussing issue idea each ChatGPT query uses bottle water has become viral fundamentally misunderstands how modern data centre cooling works When training models lot GPUs used get hot Real hot keep them running efficiently need cooled down Cold water used do so Yes some older data centres use evaporative cooling where water evaporates remove heat industry rapidly shifting closed loop systems where water circulates without evaporation basically cooled run through servers cool off GPUs warm hot water returned reservoir cooled fixation water consumption understandable s easy visualise bottle water per query s dramatic scary sounding s increasingly outdated cooling technology evolves real environmental challenge lies elsewhere Real Issue Electricity While water concerns bit red herring electricity consumption AI s genuine environmental challenge Cooling water requires guessed electricity do all other data centre operations during training inference Electricity problem here water I m going give current figures I highly recommend research all up yourself hard Deep Research modes figures always changing so being current important Here s high level summary without getting weeds those projections hold data centre operations could soak up close 3 global electricity within five years s lot s growing undeniable Yes AI energy intensive how does compare other activities take granted where gets interesting problem decrying AI s energy usage need aware larger context I always get comments my TikToks YouTube videos about AI s energy usage so good place begin comparison video gets 10 million views 120M watt hours 400 million AI queries Video streaming unlike AI queries send ChatGPT massively scalable What about TikTok other platforms My viral TikTok videos watched 10 million people have done incalculably more damage environment than any AI work I have done Hell more than AI work I ve inspired other people do have aware all other uses energy why when someone hyper fixates AI s electricity impact s important remind them all other uses power engage everyday Yes training AI rather than inference also uses lot power I ve left out simplicity remember producing TikTok videos Netflix shows like also takes massive amount energy too Also here s biggie Above I mentioned data centres currently consume 1 5 world s electricity potentially doubling 3 5 years Well what s other 98 5 97 s manufacturing transportation construction consumer electronics etc don t hear much about remaining 97 because unlike AI s emotive Industry Response Standing Still AI industry has also recognised electricity problems same time model efficiency always improving Basically newer models achieve better results less energy requirements Hardware improvements continue reduce power per computation Don t get me wrong all isn t out goodness hearts s about profit AI power hungry have seen So company cheapest access electricity know building own nuclear power stations most efficient models have lowest costs Lower electricity bill company profits more companies may wrap initiatives up environmental clothing raw profit root decisions Which better worse arguably much stronger force than sense responsibility Practical Steps Businesses All well good discussing energy usage audience client s even better give them solid steps can actually take Some practical steps 1 Right Size Models Don t use GPT 4o tasks GPT 3 5 can handle Model selection significantly impacts energy use 2 Optimise Token Usage concise prompts context Every token processed consumes energy Sam Altman has told stop saying please thank 3 Strategic Timing Location 4 Choose Green Providers Select cloud providers committed renewable energy efficient operations 5 Deploy Local Models When Appropriate simple repetitive tasks local models can more efficient than cloud APIs often best way deal questions public talks basically turn around them Assume AI here stay any company without trouble from here segue helping them limit impact brings discussion from emotive AI destroying planet productive Here s actual plan Argument Summary When addressing AI s environmental impact water consumption fears based outdated understanding cooling systems focusing electricity usage provides more accurate picture AI s environmental impact AI currently represents tiny fraction global energy consumption 1 3 environmental concern should proportional panicked AI companies have profit motives improve efficiency energy costs money market forces naturally drive continued improvements energy efficiency re concerned about AI s energy use should apply similar scrutiny all digital activities streaming gaming social media single out AI Therefore AI s environmental impact requires balanced attention real concerns addressed through practical solutions dismissed catastrophised my perspective always adapt based industry context local environmental priorities genuine concerns play here just need sure focus real issues rather than headline de jour What s Next Next up ll tackle final curveball question AI development moving too fast question touches safety regulation tension between innovation responsibility I ll share how address concerns about AI s somewhat scary breakneck pace while acknowledging competitive gulp geopolitical realities
