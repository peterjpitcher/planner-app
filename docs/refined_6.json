sender]","subject":"Mixer AI Performance Details Analysis","body":"Hi Pete Thanks reaching out Today MJ I have sat down reviewed performance bit more detail article has seen few dips performance took up big percentage clicks drives MixerAI numbers down keywords have seen biggest drops follows Performance down keywords due Google currently ranking recipes within recipe section SERP Google has pushed content down page slightly wanted let ranking fluctuations play out few weeks before looking make page content edits Let consider February okay Outside help dig deeper wider set MixerAI articles below have removed Burrito Guide have now audited performance from past 3 months vs 3 months before findings follows s interesting note large organic impressions clicks isn t from UK audience Pulling numbers past 3 months vs 3 months before can see UK does drive most clicks However most significant drop did come from take past three months work out UK traffic can see UK drove highest clicks close behind Country Last 3 months clicks Previous 3 months clicks Last 3 months Impressions Last 3 months Impressions United Kingdom 47 83 39 30 30 27 25 09 United States 19 88 26 63 42 40 42 54 Canada 7 36 10 91 3 72 4 56 Australia 4 82 5 36 3 79 5 89 Germany 2 79 2 14 0 83 0 85 Ireland 2 48 2 44 0 78 1 13 France 2 30 1 42 0 49 0 39 addition UK s traffic much lower than I would have expected which does go show content creating working hard ranking markets maybe shouldn t only worked OEP com could HREFLang tie all together does however raise question why clicks impressions have dropped have therefore kicked off audit firstly below ORGANIC REVIEW Top level can see Clicks dropped 50 Impressions increased 0 85 CTR dropped 50 Rankings had slight dip Digging deeper articles have seen biggest decline follows Digging deeper again below keywords had most significant drops Please note today have spent time working through few landing pages keyword examples save getting too long I have given most significant findings below can freeze tortilla wraps Since publishing article have held very strong ranking 1 2 Google USA results However last few months Google has upped AIO game has pushed standard rankings down conclude believe clicks down due Less searches general which why impressions down remained ranking highly across all months CTR dropped due AIOs appearing However good see Google displaying citation AIOs finally worth noting impressions down keyword what serve fajitas article has had bit rollercoaster last few months can see have ranked between 1st 8th over last 6 months Its worth noting Google has started show AIOs more often appearing witin section highlighted below cites OEP UK content s also worth noting search volume trends down over November December keyword birthday party food ideas keyword one term has dropped off first page Google s results can see below Google did try rank highly quickly after launch since has slowly dropped away conclude s great see OEP UK content ranking results have seen decline clicks mostly due search volume dropping Nov Dec addition seeing rise AIOs which causing decrease organic CTRs Kim did review content suggested few edits lets monitor any uplifts take action from next few months UK ORGANIC REVIEW Now bringing back UK Top level can see Clicks dropped 19 Impressions increased 22 CTR dropped 30 Rankings had dip 31 Digging deeper articles have seen biggest decline follows Digging even deeper see following terms had biggest decrease clicks what serve fajitas Despite still retaining 1st place position keyword average can see total clicks have practically halved again likely due increase AI Overviews While Google citing one top sources s possible users getting all information need from AIO therefore clicking through landing page screenshot below demonstrates how prominent search term Regarding decrease impressions September December see lower searches term which tends pick up again from January how freeze tortilla wraps Looking Mixer AI keyword second biggest fall clicks how freeze tortilla wraps see position has remained unchanged from first place Investigating screenshot below again see similar trend first instance where featured AIO deflecting users away from page However yet again also see seasonal trend where searches topic decrease November December Fajita sides see same trend fajita sides where position has remained roughly same clicks impressions CTR have dropped Search volumes again demonstrate seasonal decline searches keyword However each saw decrease impressions also due decreased seasonal searches where did overall increase impressions come from Looking see Vegetables would appear Mixer AI article how eat more vegetables summer has accrued 21 673 impressions from keyword vegetables However impressions from ranking Google images opposed regular listing Boxing Day Food Similarly would appear Boxing Day article has contributed climb impressions Looking data can see rank within Recipe Gallery following keywords some others However given Boxing Day has now passed impressions have dropped away conclude UK market still maintain first place rankings keywords despite decline clicks impressions Based trends above can conclude decrease coming from increase AIOs seasonal decline searches terms expect improve again move new season searches pick back up Impressions have increased despite fall clicks some image content ranking well Boxing Day recipe gallery ranking also generated good number impressions around period Boxing Day Any
