naturally she d use WeChat message her family different Let s get started Summary AI overhyped Why AI hype vs reality question reveals deeper truths about technological change Three contrasting perspectives AI s transformative potential Comparing AI previous tech bubbles breakthroughs concept capability overhang general purpose technologies framework discussing AI s impact avoids both cynicism utopianism Recurring Question So honest opinion AI actually transformative just another hype cycle question comes various forms underlying concern always same witnessing genuine technological revolution just latest long line overpromised tech trends business world particular pointed question boils down do need spend money all junk hype answer question can significantly impact how seriously people take expertise Too cynical risk looking like re missing biggest technological shift generation Too optimistic might come across just another hype merchant Three Competing Perspectives Position 1 s Just Another Tech Bubble cynical view sees AI latest series overhyped technologies s easy argument make point recent history Remember blockchain Internet Things Crypto NFTs metaverse Each supposed revolutionise everything where now AI just newest shiny object venture capitalists tech companies desperate pump valuations view companies slapping AI now agentic 2025 lol onto everything attract investment just added com names 1999 web3 blockchain 2017 bubble burst leaving behind failed startups wasted investments Position 2 Singularity Upon opposite extreme sci fi utopian view declares re witnessing dawn new era human existence singularity isn t coming s here Within years AI surpass human intelligence every domain ll cure cancer fix climate change upload consciousness cloud merge machines transcend biological limitations Every problem solved super intelligent AI systems All hail new AI overlords perspective sees current AI capabilities just beginning exponential curve rapidly transform humanity beyond recognition Position 3 Transformative Technology Overhyped Applications My view occupies more nuanced middle ground Seeing pattern here Boring aren t I I believe AI represents genuinely transformative technology akin internet many current applications indeed overhyped Internet Parallel understand AI s potential impact I find helpful draw parallels internet revolution I recently completed three hour motorbike trip My Son ancient Champa temples Vietnam journey took me over rice fields across car bridges through remote countryside trip would have been absolutely impossible without internet GPS navigation translation apps booking platforms payment systems weather updates ability research destination beforehand internet has become so pervasive barely notice how underpins nearly every aspect modern life don t even think about unless goes down AI heading down similar path s par internet terms importance Bubble Within Revolution transformative technologies can both revolutionary overhyped simultaneously Huh Remember dotcom boom late 1990s Maybe probably younger than me bubble burst 2000 wiping out hundreds companies trillions market value Critics declared internet overhyped Yet what emerged from ashes Google Amazon eBay PayPal infrastructure innovations dotcom era laid foundation companies would fundamentally reshape commerce information access communication From debris rose modern internet Kinda big deal re seeing same pattern AI Yes s tremendous hype Yes many current applications gimmicky poorly thought out Yes companies adding AI pitch decks without meaningful integration probably correction Maybe violent one ll messy people decry AI trash underneath all froth lies genuinely transformative technology I don t personally believe same can said Web3 blockchain crypto metaverse internet things etc solutions search problem fascinating technologies used mainly SF environs Whereas modern AI immediately took hold across broad swathes public young old Capability Overhang Ethan Mollick professor Wharton introduced concept perfectly captures current moment capability overhang Even stopped all AI development today new models improvements breakthroughs would take years humanity fully explore implement all capabilities current AI systems already possess God sounds nice I d able relax take properly holiday too Right now re like someone who just got first smartphone still using primarily make calls unaware thousands other capabilities waiting discovered because AI belongs rare category general purpose technologies confusingly acronym GPTs innovations don t just solve specific problems enable entirely new categories solutions Historical examples include steam engine Electricity microchip computer internet could probably chuck fire wheel too may have heard some pretty important Each technologies took decades even centuries reach full impact started simple applications went through periods hype disappointment ultimately transformed society ways inventors couldn t have imagined one my favourite related images from year 2000 internet Bit rubbish ll never catch Modern AI shows all hallmarks General Purpose Technology s just tool specific tasks s platform upon which countless other innovations can built right now re scratching surface Current Phase Digital Sandbox re digital sandbox phase AI similar early days internet when people were building wild experimental geocities websites flashing text auto playing MIDI files animated backgrounds Current AI applications often feel like toys Chat interfaces image generators simple automations re playing experimenting figuring out what s possible lot time pick up play quickly discarded Oh cool followed never using again 20 years ll look

those early web experiments led today s sophisticated digital ecosystem current AI toys laying groundwork profound transformations how work learn create solve problems s just re midst s hard see Argument Summary When addressing whether AI overhyped transformative AI adoption patterns mirror internet normal people using everyday tasks re witnessing genuinely transformative technology rather than niche trend previous tech bubbles dotcom crypto metaverse show hype transformation can coexist current AI hype doesn t negate its revolutionary potential AI demonstrates characteristics general purpose technology its full impact unfold over decades months re experiencing capability overhang where current AI abilities exceed implementation capacity focusing practical applications rather than

understand me better than my spouse does client recently told me Half joking I think So actually intelligent just really good faking interact systems can write poetry solve complex problems engage what feel like meaningful conversations line between simulation genuine intelligence begins blur Increasingly so models get more sophisticated When Claude ChatGPT responds apparent empathy insight experiencing something truly comparable human intelligence simply elaborate illusion created pattern matching Let s get started Summary AI intelligent AI intelligence vs mimicry Three distinct perspectives machine intelligence Why token prediction creates appearance understanding emergent properties scale large language models How definition intelligence keeps shifting practical framework discussing AI capabilities clients Philosophical Quandary question whether AI truly intelligent merely mimicking intelligence has been debated since very beginning field Turing sketched out first computer would understand solve mathematical problem shortly afterwards speculated whether machines could ever intelligent Smart guy Scary smart Whether AI intelligent touches fundamental questions about consciousness understanding what means think questions have honestly occupied philosophers millennia remain largely unresolved When fielding question several distinct perspectives could take Position 1 AI Systems Possess Different Kind Intelligence Some argue AI systems like large language models demonstrate genuine intelligence just different kind than human intelligence systems can reason through complex problems identify patterns humans might miss generate novel solutions view should broaden concept intelligence beyond human cognition Stop being so anthropocentric wont Intelligence should defined functionally what system can accomplish rather than how accomplishes whether has subjective experiences Position 2 AI Advanced Mimicry Real Understanding opposing view holds current AI systems essentially sophisticated pattern matching machines actual understanding content process perspective what looks like intelligence actually just statistical correlation massive scale Which kinda makes sense considering how LLMs work mass probability engines Proponents view often cite Chinese Room thought experiment proposed philosopher John Searle person who doesn t understand Chinese follows instructions manipulate Chinese symbols producing appropriate responses without comprehension system whole appears understand Chinese actual understanding exists anywhere within system pure mimicry Position 3 Distinction Between Real Intelligence Simulation May Matter My position more pragmatic Surprise surprise question itself might less important than think even meaningless Current AI systems neither conscious minds nor simple mechanical calculators occupy new interesting space challenges existing categories Token Prediction Explanation core large language models like GPT 4 Claude token prediction engines When input text model predicts what tokens roughly pieces words most likely follow based patterns observed its training data fundamentally different from how humans think systems don t have intentions beliefs desires don t know what words mean way do connections lived experience emotions physical sensations re processing statistical patterns meaning humans understand However doesn t mean systems simple unimpressive scale which operate leads emergent properties weren t explicitly programmed Just complex behaviours can emerge natural systems like how individual ant behaviours create sophisticated colony structures flock starlings forms murmuration complex capabilities emerge from massive statistical models weren t directly encoded Hell life itself evolution thereafter led complex outcomes from simple mechanical processes Given enough scale geological time immense data sets compute some pretty wild things emerge unbidden s also important recognise LLMs represent just one approach AI albeit dominant one moment ve had many types before which why knowing history helpful ll also have many types hereafter field continues evolve future breakthroughs may come from entirely different architectures approaches Many experts believe truly intelligent systems ultimately require different approaches hybrid methods go beyond statistical prediction paradigm ll see Moving Goal Post Problem From emergence come behaviour seem very intelligent keeps happening again again world AI humans keep shifting back goal posts ll declare something like computers great calculations sure ll never beat grandmaster chess player set arbitrary boundaries what human intelligence Which get demolished Consider pattern 1997 Chess requires unique human intelligence until Deep Blue beat Kasparov 2016 OK has finite move set so course computer could brute force Go too intuitive computers until AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol 2020 OK s just games controlled environment AI can t deal real world tasks like driving which require real world perception split second judgment until Waymo launched driverless taxis Phoenix 2023 Driving mainly mechanical AI can t handle complex reasoning professional tasks until GPT 4 started passing bar exams acing medical boards writing better code than junior devs one sentence sums up humanity s reaction AI How quick feel owed superpowers ve become so accustomed technological advances even most extraordinary achievements like passing Turing test quickly taken granted Whenever AI masters skill previously thought require human intelligence tend say Well s really intelligence goal posts what constitutes real intelligence keep moving REAL problem here humans don t even have agreed upon definition intelligence do know fully what s going squishy mass tissue inside skulls How possible wondrous things How does lumpy collection cells firing electric signals create Mona Lisa don t really know So how earth could have definition what artificial version looks like Turing Test Perspective Alan Turing anticipated philosophical quagmire before AI actually existed Again smart lad Rather than getting bogged down definitions intelligence he proposed Imitation Game now known Turing Test 1950 practical approach test focuses functionality rather than internal mechanisms machine can consistently fool humans thinking s human through conversation does matter its internal processes differ from human cognition Turing wasn t concerned whether machines were truly thinking human sense Because duh don t know what truly thinking human Turing instead interested whether could produce outputs indistinguishable from human outputs much more practical question Fun fact early 2025 researchers from UC San Diego conducted proper Turing test GPT 4 5 When prompted adopt humanlike persona GPT 4 5 judged human 73 time significantly more often than real human participants After 75 years Turing test finally passed public reaction collective shrug moved goalposts Yet again Practical Approach AI Experts So how should respond when clients audiences ask whether AI really intelligent I find most useful reframe question entirely Rather than diving philosophical waters about nature consciousness understanding focus what systems can cannot do how differ from human intelligence what means practical applications What matters isn t whether systems think human sense how can complement human thinking what new capabilities enable what risks limitations need aware history technology shows most transformative tools aren t those perfectly replicate human abilities those extend them new directions calculator doesn t think like mathematician dramatically enhances mathematical capabilities Engines do replicate muscular movements make physical labour much easier Similarly AI systems don t need replicate human cognition revolutionary Argument Summary When addressing whether AI truly intelligent merely mimicking intelligence intelligence defined observable capabilities outputs rather than internal processes consciousness distinction between real intelligence simulated intelligence becomes largely philosophical rather than practical large language models fundamentally prediction engines working statistical patterns lack human like understanding can still produce results require intelligence when humans perform them history shows continually redefine intelligence once machines master previously intelligent tasks focusing specific capabilities limitations more productive than debating whether AI really intelligent Again just one perspective AI continues evolve understanding intelligence itself may transform argued about philosophers cognitive scientists AI researchers Fantastic Let them get rest only practical answer here functional What can AI do what can t do How can use technology improve lives Focusing here far more rewarding What s Next Tomorrow ll

audiences doesn t really matter need have answers fingertips what separates casual AI enthusiast from genuine AI expert When position yourself authority AI field big thorny questions come way often public high pressure settings where response can make break credibility Playbook re tackling five most common curveball questions ll face AI expert Having fielded questions countless times stage workshops during consulting engagements I m sharing my approach each along alternative perspectives might consider I am all end all Far from I m probably very wrong ha I want i surface questions get asked ii give my answers iii help start formulate own So when question asked ll ready wow asker expert research team spends all day learning what s new AI talking industry experts distills most important developments one free email every morning Plus complete quiz after signing up ll recommend best AI tools guides courses tailored needs Let s get started Summary AI take my job Why AI take jobs 1 question ll face Three competing perspectives AI employment Why job erosion rather than job replacement real concern generational impact who affected when concise memorable position can adapt own expertise Inevitable Question AI take jobs isn t just common question s practically inevitable my experience doesn t come up during formal Q emerge during breaks private conversations follow up emails makes perfect sense people s livelihoods professional identities stake won t necessarily asked blunt way Often layers people ask about automation hiring practices job progression underlying root cause same my job safe Let s look three distinct positions might take Position 1 AI Create More Jobs Than Eliminates optimistic view holds like previous technological revolutions AI ultimately create more opportunities than displaces Proponents point history industrial revolution computerisation internet all sparked initial fear ultimately expanded job market view while certain roles disappear entirely new categories jobs emerge AI trainers AI ethics specialists prompt engineers countless roles can t yet imagine key adaptation re skilling I personally don t believe AI different because whereas other technologies augmented human skill intelligence AI can potentially wholesale replace can also self improve which other technology human history has been able do s new territory so applying existing historical paradigms risky Position 2 AI Job Apocalypse Coming flip side alarmist perspective suggests re facing something fundamentally different from previous technological shifts Because AI can potentially automate both physical cognitive tasks threatens much broader swath employment even knowledge work previously seemed immune automation view suggests massive displacement across industries only small fraction new AI related jobs created replace those lost result widespread unemployment profound economic disruption I think closer long term truth ll need find different ways organise economies Remember modern capitalism only actually 400 500 years old Seems like long time absolutely s small blip terms human history even terms civilisation West assume s primary way organise societies economically indeed all humans agree doesn t preclude other forms Something have shift s just very difficult predict what Position 3 AI Erode Job Creation Transform Organisational Structures My position takes more nuanced middle path I m focusing short medium term where can predict little more accuracy Trying prognosticate out too far fool s errand so instead let s keep focused I believe primary impact won t sudden job displacement gradual erosion job creation particularly entry levels which ultimately transform organisational structures Less utopian less apocalyptic Let me outline my basic argument How AI Transform Employment Erosion Theory I used repeat common refrain AI won t take job someone using AI take job I ve come believe overly simplistic 2024 old school reality I think more subtle many ways more concerning Rather than directly eliminating existing positions AI more likely slow stop creation new jobs particularly entry level has profound implications organisational structures career pathways Consider fields like law accounting business analytics most algorithmic routine work tends happen early career stages s how new hires cut teeth aren t given responsibility right out gate instead go through basic grunt work first roles law clerks doing document review junior accountants processing transactions analysts creating standard reports precisely where AI excels Ruh roh shaggy tools become more sophisticated organisations need fewer entry level staff re already seeing beginnings hiring freezes reduced head counts sectors robust AI adoption re currently established career especially mid senior levels re likely relatively safe short term ve put years secured position role probably involves complex judgment interpersonal skills institutional knowledge AI can t easily replicate Yet here s where secondary effects become important harder many grasp Most organisations structured like pyramids more people bottom than top reduce base pyramid through AI automation downstream consequences entire structure fewer junior staff manage organisations need fewer managers fewer managers need fewer directors executives get picture similar what happens aging population countries like Japan probably more familiar particular Jenga tower I think ll see something similar AI s effects work Over time re talking years even decades combination fewer entry level positions improved AI capabilities likely transform many traditional career ladders organisational structures entirely Who Affected When timeline impact vary significantly depending career stage re established career immediate effects likely minimal Organisations regulatory frameworks move slowly skills like judgment creativity interpersonal dynamics remain challenging AI replicate industry unionised Likely effects even slower job may evolve incorporate AI tools wholesale replacement unlikely near term retirement within sight can likely navigate finish line Congrats dodging bullets like Neo aren t entering workforce another 10 years still school equally lucky world has time adapt new technology ll stepping transformed landscape advantage ll enter knowing new rules game without having unlearn old patterns re messy middle finishing up university early career early 20s sorry facing most challenging transition may graduate environment where traditional entry level positions have significantly diminished same time new roles haven t yet opened up because older institutions working out how deal whole AI thing group need particularly adaptive entrepreneurial can t wait world sort itself out need get taking control yourself everyone regardless career stage I believe developing alternative income streams entrepreneurial skills increasingly essential isn t just about financial safety nets s about developing adaptability self direction increasingly valuable whatever economic reality find ourselves Entrepreneurial Opportunity One most profound ironies AI revolution while may reduce traditional employment opportunities simultaneously makes entrepreneurship more accessible than ever When I launched my first business I had handle everything myself building products writing marketing copy designing websites providing customer service full spectrum While educational extraordinarily difficult build sustainable income way took decade plus realistically start making good money s too long I wouldn t recommend my worst enemy s changing now asks once required teams specialists coding design content creation marketing customer support can now accomplished augmented through AI tools individuals small teams barriers entry starting business have never been lower I m writing Vietnamese coffee shop right now whilst another window Cursor chugs away building SEO optimised website me someone who started building businesses before times believe me special Today s entrepreneurs read can leverage AI handle augment many startup tasks fact precisely why I ve focused my work AI entrepreneurship help people harness tools create sustainable independent income streams regardless what happens traditional employment models Argument Summary OK so here s quick roundup basic thrust So when asked question about job security have framework answer AI excels automating routine algorithmic tasks concentrated entry level positions job creation levels gradually erode rather than existing jobs suddenly disappearing entry level positions diminish over time organisational structures transform from bottom up like removing lower blocks from tower organisational structures fundamentally change impact varies career stage minimal established careers challenging early careers transformative new entrants However same AI making traditional employment uncertain also makes entrepreneurship more accessible than ever Remember just one perspective I m particularly smart AI s rapid development one

most from reasoning models Prompt Entrepreneur","body":"Prompt Playbook Prompting Fundamentals Hey Prompt Entrepreneur I recently had call founder who frustrated new AI models were getting stupider were plugging information before AI tripping over itself thinking loops generally making pigs ear all I asked them show me Turns out were adding think step step every prompt just d learned from countless prompting guides weren t doing anything wrong per se AI landscape had simply shifted beneath feet Increasingly have so called reasoning models What re witnessing fascinating modern reasoning models now do much thinking internally automatically breaking problems steps before responding Adding explicit step step instructions can actually disrupt process like interrupting someone who s already deep thought asking what thinking about conclude Playbook prompting let s explore how reasoning techniques evolving new best practices keep ahead curve Let s get started Summary Prompting Reasoning models Understanding evolution AI reasoning capabilities What Chain Thought actually why revolutionised AI performance new approach reasoning prompts modern AI landscape Six best practices working reasoning models Tree Thoughts other advanced techniques complex problems Wrapping up week prompting mastery Understanding AI Reasoning its core reasoning AI about breaking complex problems manageable steps considering multiple perspectives weighing evidence drawing logically sound conclusions Kinda same humans s different discussion Very crudely have non reasoning models reasoning models Early AI models typically jumped straight conclusions without methodically working through problems led development techniques like Chain Thought prompting which served external scaffolding guide AI toward more thorough analysis GPT 3 5 4 examples Modern reasoning models now have much analytical capability built automatically Break complex problems logical steps Consider multiple approaches before settling one Check work errors inconsistencies Revise thinking when spot potential issues internal reasoning happens before see response like model drafts detailed analysis edits down just essential conclusions s pretty magical Understanding evolution crucial effective prompting What worked brilliantly previous generations models might now redundant even counterproductive need adapt techniques match capabilities models re using Chain Thought What Why Matters Chain Thought CoT prompting one most significant breakthroughs getting better performance from AI systems Before talk about how s evolving let s understand what actually why so revolutionary What Chain Thought its simplest Chain Thought prompting technique asks AI break down its thinking process visible steps before providing answer Instead jumping straight conclusions model shows its reasoning like working out math problem paper instead just writing answer Here s what CoT looks like practice Standard prompt What s average monthly payment 300 000 mortgage 4 5 interest rate over 25 year term more often than go horribly wrong Older models bit crap sort mathematical logical reasoning might run prompt 10 times get 10 different answers bueno Instead Chain Thought prompt What s average monthly payment 300 000 mortgage 4 5 interest rate over 25 year term Let s work through step step CoT prompt model might respond something like Let s work through step step 1 First I need convert annual interest rate monthly rate 4 5 per year 12 0 375 per month 2 Next I ll convert decimal 0 375 0 00375 3 number payments 25 years 12 months 300 payments 4 Now I can use mortgage payment formula M P r 1 r n 1 r n 1 where M monthly payment P principal 300 000 r monthly interest rate 0 00375 n number payments 300 5 Substituting values M 300 000 0 00375 1 00375 300 1 00375 300 1 M 300 000 0 00375 3 0991 3 0991 1 M 300 000 0 0116 2 0991 M 3 486 36 2 0991 M 1 660 88 Therefore monthly payment would approximately 1 661 Why CoT Revolutionary Chain Thought transformed AI performance several critical reasons 1 Error Reduction breaking problems steps models became much less likely make calculation errors logical mistakes Each intermediate step serves checkpoint keeping reasoning track 2 Complex Problem Solving CoT allowed models tackle much more complex problems than could previously handle Problems require multiple steps reasoning became solvable 3 Transparency visible reasoning gave users insight how AI approaching problems making possible spot where things might going wrong 4 Educational Value step step approach made AI outputs more useful learning users could follow reasoning process rather than just seeing answer s sort like writing workings out maths exam 5 Confidence Assessment Users could evaluate soundness AI s reasoning rather than having blindly trust its conclusions Traditional models give answer have just hope s true Which tricky because hallucinations exist impact CoT can t overstated turned models from simple text predictors systems capable sophisticated reasoning across mathematics logic planning more certain situations very clever hack get better results from AI Now though have models do reasoning models New Approach Reasoning Prompts Modern reasoning models now generate own internal chain thought before responding Think o Series ChatGPT o1 o3 example any AI has Deep Research function think through problems step step check work sometimes even revise thinking all before showing single word running chain thought process internally some bells whistles course changes everything about how should prompt models Rather than forcing model show every step its reasoning can now focus guiding its attention shaping its output Six Best Practices evolving field so now ll stick best practices rather than hard fast rules everything AI s fluid Working modern reasoning models requires new set best practices 1 Guide don t babysit AI already thinks just give clear job Example re growth marketer Suggest 3 paid channels 10k budget Rather than scripting every step thinking process do non reasoning models focus clearly defining task letting model s internal reasoning take care rest So context RISEN framework can drop S 2 Lead role Start telling model who Example re CFO explaining cash flow non finance staff Role based prompting provides context shapes how model approaches problem without micromanaging its reasoning process remains valid reasoning models re just telling who reason retain R RISEN framework 3 State output first Spell out format style before asking Example Return 5 bullet checklist each bullet 20 words clearly defining what want final output look like can let model handle reasoning process while ensuring get result exactly format need E RISEN still valid 4 Prototype hot deploy cold Tinker loose settings lock them down Example Draft ideas temperature 0 7 final runs 0 2 When developing prompts use higher temperature settings explore different approaches Once ve found what works lower temperature consistent reliable results generally good advice all prompt engineering great variability reasoning models makes even more powerful 5 Budget tokens like cash Extra words extra cost Trim fat Example Paste exec summary 30 page report Since modern models handle reasoning internally can focus providing just essential information needed rather than including verbose instructions even more important than non reasoning models because additional costs associated them 6 Build fallback Use cheaper models easy jobs premium tough ones Example Use advanced models strategy simpler models spell check practice recognises all tasks require sophisticated reasoning match model complexity task talk about capability cliff before particularly case reasoning models which tend more expensive Advanced Techniques Complex Problems While basic reasoning now baked many models via chain thought certain complex problems still benefit from specialised approaches just additional ways nudge how AI think deeper work reasoning non reasoning models worth adding toolkit Tree Thoughts Exploring Multiple Paths Tree Thoughts encourages AI consider multiple solutions before committing one similar how chess players evaluate different moves before choosing How works problem challenge please 1 Generate 3 distinct approaches solving 2 Briefly evaluate each approach s strengths limitations 3 Select most promising approach develop full solution technique particularly effective Open ended problems multiple valid solutions Creative challenges requiring exploration different ideas Complex planning scenarios Situations where initial approach might lead dead ends Step Back Prompting Gaining Perspective Step back prompting asks AI consider broader context before addressing specifics like taking step back see whole forest before examining individual trees How works Before addressing specific question about topic first consider broader context relevant principles frameworks expert would apply provide focused answer approach works particularly well Problems benefit from contextualising Situations where jumping specifics might miss important considerations Coding problems when AI hyper fixating something minor Self Consistency Improving Reliability Self consistency involves having AI verify its own work using different approaches like double checking calculation using different method How works I need reliable answer problem Please 1 Solve using primary method 2 Verify solution using different approach 3 discrepancies determine which approach more reliable why technique valuable High stakes decisions where accuracy crucial Problems multiple valid solution methods Questions where ve previously received inconsistent answers building workflows software might use less advanced read cheaper model check work more advanced model just supplementals ways get AI solve problems Honestly solid human thinking methods just become prompting techniques because particular context Rememebr all ultimately communicating what want AI do Wrapping Up ve covered significant ground prompting

because i depends goal ii my recommendation today different my recommendation week two Everything just moves so fast field moving quickly s futile rely static recommendations Rather than telling Model X best task Y which might outdated before even finish reading I realised need something much more valuable framework evaluating models yourself along tools stay current landscape evolves Part I ll show tools need make decision yourself Let s get started Summary Which AI model best Which AI model best Why model recommendations become outdated almost immediately Essential tools comparing models yourself real time Understanding capability cliff avoiding model overkill real world implications closed vs open source models How create own benchmark tests specific needs Using variables templates consistent results across models Strategies handling model updates changes Futility Static Model Recommendations s one constant AI world s change Here s sobering fact over last 12 months ve seen more than 50 significant model releases updates from major providers s including hundreds nay thousands smaller models out I keep up stuff living s overwhelming So anyone out also building business know having life I can t imagine how overwhelming What state art last quarter might middling today what works best summarisation might different from what excels code generation s LOT rapid pace development means any article guide newsletter yes even one makes specific claims about which model best comes expiration date s less than pint milk I ve learned lesson hard way Last year I wrote detailed comparison top models content creation spent hours testing benchmarking rendered largely obsolete just two weeks later when two major providers released updated models Does mean just give up Nah Let s focus equipping tools frameworks remain valuable regardless which specific models leading pack month Real Time Model Comparison Resources I m going delegate hard work here just tell resources I personally use great starting point platform allows filter models based specific criteria like reasoning ability factual accuracy creative writing helping quickly narrow down which models might appropriate specific needs regularly subjects AI models IQ style tests Whilst isn t foolproof benchmark spoiler aren t any s good quick look smarter models user can actually run prompts tell LM Arena which model does best job turn helps LM Arena ranking models Unlike other sites here actively contribute rankings all useful tools hone potential models prompting task Think them way give shortlist From here can further narrow down options until find best model First though major warning Avoiding Model Overkill One most important concepts understand when selecting models capability cliff point which model becomes good enough specific needs Paying capabilities beyond cliff often yields diminishing returns example let s say want build prompts workflows answer customer service emails would test same prompt across several models Model basic produced usable responses about 65 time Model B mid tier produced usable responses about 85 time Model C advanced produced usable responses about 92 time Model D cutting edge produced usable responses about 94 time Seeing might naturally think OK easy Model D re done here quality isn t only factor play here Imagine price difference between Model B Model D 10x Yet actual improvement usable outputs just 9 percentage points Huh OK changes things example workflow Model B represents capability cliff point where model good enough needs point 85 reliability very low cost don t get much marginal improvement spending awful lot more can instead focus refining from low cost result Finding Own Capability Cliff identify capability cliff own use case here s rough outline 1 Define what good enough means specific task depends business abstract AI benchmarks 2 Test increasingly capable models until reach threshold 3 Calculate effective cost per task each model 4 Look inflection point where improvements longer justify increased costs ideal model always most advanced one s one satisfies requirements lowest cost simple content generation older smaller models might perfectly adequate complex reasoning tasks might indeed need most advanced options right option depends entirely goal So don t fall trap falling off cliff Wile E Coyote style Closed vs Open Understanding Implications other BIG decision factor here open vs closed source Closed proprietary models like GPT 4 Claude Gemini open source models like Llama Mistral various community models have different pros cons Generally frontier models most advanced proprietary makes lot sense because companies have tonne cash throw improving models some uses may want use open source model When Using Through APIs re accessing models through official APIs web interfaces closed vs open distinction matters less from technical perspective re essentially consuming model service regardless whether underlying technology open closed What does matter Pricing Different providers have vastly different pricing models costs Data policies How inputs handled stored potentially used training may big deal organisation depending sensitivity data Reliability guaranteed uptime performance most businesses starting AI integration proprietary APIs often provide path least resistance well documented interfaces reliable performance s much easier spin up tool using existing API tradeoff typically higher cost less control over how data handled When Self Hosting re deploying models yourself working team closed vs open distinction becomes absolutely crucial Open source models can downloaded run locally fine tuned data modified via fine tuning suit specific needs gives maximum control cost savings scale full data privacy Llama Meta generally go here Closed models generally cannot self hosted Self hosting comes significant considerations Hardware requirements Larger models require substantial computing resources Technical complexity Deployment maintenance require specialised knowledge Optimisation challenges Getting decent performance require significant fine tuning Potential obsolescence may spend months fine tuning local model only blown out water next closed source ChatGPT release businesses considering path previous Playbooks cover fine tuning deployment more detail definitely hire expert key insight approach trades higher initial complexity greater control potentially lower long term costs scale s big business decision Model Selection Decision Tree OK Let s pull all together actionable decision tree privacy data sovereignty paramount Consider open source models can run locally private cloud Example choices Llama Mistral similar open models need absolute best performance regardless cost First review whether actually need best model hint often don t do use latest top tier commercial models typically cutting edge Specialised tasks might have different leaders certain models excel longer content analysis others code use one resources above hone re cost sensitive need good performance Consider smaller commercial models ie older versions current top tier models Open source models hosted affordable platforms very high volume ie b2c app custom hosting open source models may most economical speed critical Smaller

Automation Accelerator I made silly mistake I try always keep my educational material simple possible requiring additional context wherever possible However early Accelerator jumped straight discussing ChatGPT API I assuming people knew what API didn t how different normal ChatGPT Oops Mea culpa currently thinking what hell API re luck re covering today why matters me distinction between ChatGPT app API seemed obvious I d been building APIs years confused messages from several participants quickly made me realise my error What second nature me completely new territory many talented entrepreneurs moment eye opening I realised s fundamental divide AI world between casual users web interfaces those building APIs knowing which use when super important how build how prompt fundamental difference changes everything about how approach prompting When re just chatting AI through web interface can fudge way through prompts iterate until get decent outputs when re building API need solid reliable prompts work consistently much closer engineering part prompt engineering I m getting ahead myself First let s look what app vs API distinction actually means Let s get started Summary From App API Moving beyond web interfaces API integration API vs App When graduate from chat interfaces direct integration code options using AI APIs without programming Temperature Controlling creativity vs consistency Token length management context windows From App API Next Level AI Usage So far series ve primarily focused techniques can use standard app versions AI systems s web applications like ChatGPT Claude mobile app equivalents apps what called GUIs pronounced gooey which endlessly funny GUI stands Graphical user interfaces s term from age computing when having graphical interface actually novel Before all text based think DOS my age above Either way interfaces where most people start AI journey many users re perfectly adequate Limitations App Based AI Whilst apps great starting points have significant limitations become apparent when start using AI more seriously Manual Intervention Every interaction requires someone type prompts copy paste results making automation impossible Inconsistent Parameters Settings may change between sessions updates affecting output consistency Limited Integration apps mainly exist islands separate from existing systems workflows Restricted Customisation re limited features controls provider chooses expose interface AI usage evolves from casual experimentation core business processes limitations start become real bottlenecks When want start getting sophisticated therefore need move away from apps towards API Understanding APIs Direct Access AI Power Oh great Another acronym API stands Application Programming Interface Software engineers aren t great naming things so ll have excuse complex names APIs basically way different software systems communicate each other s context AI models API allows software connect directly AI service send prompts receive answers automatically more fussing about app interface writing prompts more manual entry Everything gets sent back forth behind scenes without VERY different essential when building automations software tools need work when aren t around Let s hammer home key differences Automation APIs allow systems interact AI automatically without human intervention Consistency can set maintain exact parameters every request ensuring consistent outputs Integration APIs let incorporate AI capabilities directly existing software workflows Volume can process hundreds thousands requests efficiently Cost API requests fractions penny pay per usage rather than flat 20 month Customisation APIs offer more control parameters options than typically exposed apps Using AI app like ordering food restaurant counter re limited what s menu board how staff trained serve Using API like having direct access kitchen can customise ingredients cooking techniques presentation exact specifications does mean API always better than using app pros cons here Ordering via menu much easier know what ll get head back kitchen yes absolutely have more control also more likely make huge mess Shifting Prompting Paradigm transition from GUI API fundamentally changes how approach prompting Here s why app prompt engineering often exploratory iterative can try different approaches real time Immediate feedback lets adjust fly Inconsistencies might annoying aren t catastrophic can clarify refine through conversation Basically can fudge way through combination zero one few shot prompting described before mixed providing context file uploads Projects can get done Even s bit messy app versions give flexibility API environments prompt engineering becomes much more rigorous prompts need work reliably without human intervention Consistency across thousands interactions becomes critical Failures can affect automated systems end users high volume Edge cases need handled gracefully without human supervision where prompt engineering truly becomes engineering re longer casually crafting messages re designing robust systems need work reliably scale prompts need work without nudging them along fixing them fly need work whilst sleeping So need get more sophisticated ll touch shortly after I explain how exactly use API Two Ways Access APIs Once decide move beyond GUI interfaces two main approaches using APIs 1 Code Tools Platforms like Zapier Make Bubble let connect AI APIs without writing code simply Get API key which looks something like sk ajhdf172kasdfy2 Connect key code platform Build workflows visually using drag drop interfaces perfect automating straightforward tasks like generating content based triggers analysing incoming data connecting AI other services like email Slack 2 Custom Development more complex needs can build custom applications directly integrate AI APIs requires some programming knowledge offers maximum flexibility Again ll need API key authenticate requests Either way fundamental concept same re using API key send receive messages directly model bypassing chat interface entirely direct connection what enables automation consistency Allowing build actual products AI Temperature Creativity Dial When using API have some additional dials can play One most important controls disposal temperature setting essentially determines how creative predictable AI Temperature controls randomness AI s selection process Without getting weeds when generating text AI assigns probabilities possible next words tokens Temperature determines how funky gets those probabilities Low temperature 0 0 0 3 AI almost always chooses most probable next token resulting more predictable consistent outputs like following recipe exactly written Medium temperature 0 4 0 7 AI sometimes chooses less probable tokens introducing moderate variability like chef who mostly follows recipe occasionally adds own twist High temperature 0 8 1 0 AI frequently chooses less probable tokens creating more surprising creative sometimes erratic outputs like experimental cooking exciting always successful When using APIs temperature becomes especially important because need deliberately choose right setting each use case factual tasks structured outputs code generation lower temperature 0 0 0 3 provides consistency accuracy content creation marketing copy ideas generation medium temperature 0 4 0 7 balances creativity coherence brainstorming creative writing generating diverse alternatives higher temperature 0 8 introduces more variety API settings ll often set different temperatures different endpoint functions within same application using low temperatures data processing higher temperatures creative content generation How do know which exact temperature work best can use above ranges guidelines ultimately testing When building prompts repeat use ll test results range temperatures see which works best Context Windows Token Management next big consideration when using API dealing context windows Every AI system has limits how much text can process once its context window API settings understanding managing limits becomes even more critical Much more so than apps where can just start new chat context window AI s working memory everything can see once when generating response includes prompt any examples previous messages system instructions Context windows measured tokens token roughly don t come me 3 4 word English so 4 000 token context window can handle about 3 000 words combined prompt response Ish Sorta More less API settings need manage context explicitly 1 Cost Considerations Most API providers charge per token Larger prompts higher costs could just use maximum context each every prompt ll rack up costs much much faster So need smart 2 Performance Impact Larger contexts generally mean slower responses higher computation costs makes sense every prompt send includes whole brand book AI needs read first re clogging up works 3 Error Prevention Exceeding context limits API call causes errors can break automated workflows Go over memory AI forget parts context results get real bad real soon means when building API need actually pay attention volume information putting How much additional context do really need upload Before apps just chucked everything hoped best when building API need more strategic Context Window Sizes Growing good news context windows have expanded dramatically When ChatGPT launched 2022 its window just 4 000 tokens 3000 words Current standard models typically offer 128 000 tokens Gemini models have context windows millions range positive note though limits expanding all time so question context window management may become moot move forward said efficient token usage likely remain important cost performance environmental reasons Just because could use 1M tokens help write tweet does mean should Playgrounds Bridge Between GUI API All may sound intimidating Sorry Here s nice easy segue working more advanced level prompt engineering I strongly recommend spending time playground environments interfaces offer best both worlds user friendly experience apps parameter control visibility APIs Playgrounds let 1 Experiment Parameters Adjust temperature context limits other settings immediate feedback Basically given dials within nice GUI 2 See API Calls View exact API code would generate results 3 Test Prompts Validate prompts work consistently before integrating them systems 4 Compare Models Try different model versions side side Think playgrounds training wheels API usage let experiment refine approach before committing full integration I highly recommend go kick tyres API over playground see all action What s Next Today ve explored transition from apps APIs how shift fundamentally changes approach prompting ve covered technical controls like temperature context management become
