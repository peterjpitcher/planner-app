-- Stop new functions granting EXECUTE to PUBLIC, which anon inherits.
--
-- WHY
--   20260905053043 ran `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public REVOKE
--   EXECUTE ON FUNCTIONS FROM PUBLIC`, and that line did nothing. Default
--   privileges set for a schema are ADDED to the global ones and cannot take
--   away a privilege granted globally, and EXECUTE for PUBLIC on every new
--   function is Postgres's built-in global default. With no global
--   pg_default_acl row to override it, a function created by postgres in public
--   still gets PUBLIC EXECUTE, and anon is a member of PUBLIC, so anon can call
--   it with nobody having granted anything. The same migration's revokes from
--   anon, on tables, sequences and functions, did work.
--
--   Read-only on production (hufxwovthhsjmtifvign, Postgres 15.8) on 29
--   September 2026: pg_default_acl holds no global row, and for postgres-owned
--   functions in public only `postgres/public/f {postgres=X, authenticated=X,
--   service_role=X}`, so a new function there would read {=X/postgres,
--   postgres=X, authenticated=X, service_role=X}. None of the 23 existing
--   public functions is anon-executable, because every migration since has
--   revoked PUBLIC by hand. The risk is the next function someone creates
--   without `revoke ... from public`.
--
-- WHAT THIS CHANGES
--   One global default for the postgres role: new functions it creates, in any
--   schema, no longer grant EXECUTE to PUBLIC. The per-schema grants still add
--   on top, so in public a new function reads {postgres=X, authenticated=X,
--   service_role=X}. A function the public site genuinely needs must carry an
--   explicit GRANT to anon, which is the point, and so must a new function that
--   an RLS policy anon queries through calls, or that query fails with 42501
--   instead of returning rows. Existing functions are untouched: default
--   privileges only apply when an object is created, and CREATE OR REPLACE
--   keeps an existing function's grants.
--
--   Checked before choosing the global form, because it reaches beyond public:
--     extensions  postgres owns pgcrypto, uuid-ossp, pgjwt and
--                 pg_stat_statements on production, all at their default
--                 version, so no pending update can create a function under the
--                 new default. pg_trgm, in public, is owned by supabase_admin.
--                 A NEW extension created as postgres is owned by
--                 supabase_admin (checked on this project's image,
--                 supabase/postgres 15.8.1.085), so its functions keep PUBLIC
--                 EXECUTE.
--     graphql, graphql_public, realtime, vault, pgbouncer, auth, storage
--                 functions there are owned by supabase_admin or a Supabase
--                 service role, and postgres cannot create in any of them.
--
--   supabase_admin is deliberately left alone. Its default privileges in public
--   grant anon EXECUTE outright, but postgres is not a member of supabase_admin
--   on production (checked with pg_has_role), so a migration cannot change them.
--   Nothing in this repository creates functions as supabase_admin.
--
-- GUARDED
--   It refuses to run as any role but postgres, because the proof below creates a
--   function as the current role and would test the wrong defaults otherwise. It
--   then creates a probe function in public and raises, rolling the whole
--   migration back, if the probe carries a PUBLIC grant or anon can execute it.
--   The probe is dropped in the same transaction, so nobody ever sees it.
--
-- IDEMPOTENT: yes. Revoking what is already revoked leaves the same global row.
--
-- ROLLBACK (restores exactly the state before this ran: no global row)
--   alter default privileges for role postgres grant execute on functions to public;
--   Re-granting PUBLIC makes the global ACL equal to the built-in default, and
--   Postgres removes such a row rather than storing it.
